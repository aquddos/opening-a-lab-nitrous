# Opening A Lab

## Opening a Lab

The deep integration of Learn, Git, and GitHub means that you can actually use the native `git` command line application to work on Learn. `git` is complex so we're going to show how it works, but we're also going to show you how to use the simpler `learn` CLI to open a lab.

There are two ways to open a lab on Learn.

1. You can Fork and `git clone` it via Github and `git`.
2. You can use `learn open` via the Learn CLI. **`learn open` and the Learn CLI is the preferred way to work.**

## Opening a Lab with Git CLI

 The `git` command line is something every developer uses hundreds of times a day, so while a bit technical, it's a good thing know.

In this lesson, we'll show you the sequence of steps (or workflow) needed to use git to solve labs on Learn. Don't worry too much about understanding the details of each command. And there is a simpler workflow that you're going to learn about soon using the `learn` command line application that automates all of this, so really, don't worry if this seems overly complex or cumbersome. Be brave.

### Step 1: Fork on Github

The first step of solving any code lab on Learn is to "fork" the lab's repo to your GitHub account.

Forking means that you're creating your own copy of the lab so that you can solve it.

Every lab is initially stored in GitHub in an account called `learn-co-students`. Every student has access to that lab. But if you solve that copy of the lab, the next student to attempt the lab will find it already solved. We can't all work on the same copy. Every student on Learn needs their own copy of the original lab. When you fork a lab, that's what you're making, your own copy of a lab. We call the original lab the "Upstream" and we call your version of the lab the "Origin". These copies are called "Remotes". The original lab is the "Upstream" remote, your fork is your "Origin" remote. This is the standard convention for open soure.  When you clone your copy (fork) of the lab, we call that copy your local copy.

#### How to Fork a lab

To get started, in Learn click "View on GitHub".

Next on Flatiron's Github page for the lab click the Fork button.

Then select your personal Github account as the location to fork to.

### Step 2: Clone it Locally

Cloning is the process of making a local copy of the lab from the personal remote of your fork on GitHub, called "Origin".

To clone, make sure you've first clicked on the SSH link, then click the
copy button next to the Clone URL to copy it to your clipboard.

Next, in Terminal navigate to the parent directory where you would like to place this lab. Then type:  `git clone <paste the clone URL here>`  

Note: You should replace the `<paste the clone URL here>` including the `<` and `>` symbols in the snippet above with your actual clone URL by pressing command+v on mac or ctrl+v on windows. Example: `git clone git@github.com:jongrover/first-lab-000.git`

<img width="100%" height="auto" src="http://ironboard-curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/front-end/lab-assets/ironboard-labs-step-2b.png" alt="Ironboard Labs Step 2b">

Don't forget to `cd` into the lab directory that was made when you cloned the lab. Once in the directory, open the directory with your favorite text editor. Try `subl .` to open in Sublime or `atom .` to open in Atom.

This setup, a terminal in the lab's directory and the lab directory open in an editor like Sublime or Atom, that's the state you want to be in when working on a lab on Learn. It means you're ready.

## Opening a Lab with Learn CLI

The Learn CLI is a command line application that allows you to interact with Learn and work on labs. With `learn` you can open labs, run tests, and submit labs.

Command Line Applications are simply programs we use through our Terminal or shell. `git` is a CLI program. When you type `learn` into your command line, you are interacting with the Learn web application through your terminal.

Let's walk through the steps you need to take to solve a lab on Learn using the Learn CLI workflow.

**The Learn CLI workflow is the preferred way to work on Learn.**

This is important and understanding how to use `learn` is crucial.

### Step 1: Opening a Lesson with `learn open`

All lessons are stored on GitHub. You need to fork and clone every lesson you want to work on. But instead of doing that through GitHub Fork and `git clone`, you can automated all these steps by using `learn open`.

When you type `learn open` in your terminal, you'll see:

![Learn Open](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/4cq930ubw2iwz40/2015-10-02%20at%204.09%20PM.png
)

Remember, my Terminal prompt is `// â™¥`, yours might be different, generally, `$`. After typing `learn open`, the `learn` application did the following:

1. Checked what your current lesson on Learn.
2. Forked that lesson on GitHub (notice the Fork light turned green on the right in Learn).
3. Cloned your fork lesson locally, generally into a directory `~/Development/code/` (which is your home directory, the `Development` folder, and then a folder `code`).
4. Prepared the lesson bundle, which isn't something you need to worry about at all yet, but it did it for you just in case.
5. `cd` changed directory into the cloned lesson's directory.
6. Opened your favorite text editor, probably Sublime Text.

If you type `learn open` you'll always end up in the right setup to work on a lab, terminal navigated into the lab's directory and and the lab's directory open in a text editor.

If you're ever lost and can't remember where your last lab was located or what you were working on, you can always type `learn open` and you'll end up in the right state.

You can also trigger `learn open` directly from the Learn.co web application by clicking "Open".

![Learn Open](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/6hmrbrtcf0gssev/2015-09-30%20at%207.11%20PM.png)

That will automatically open your terminal and execute `learn open`.

## Conclusion

The `learn` CLI workflow is a way easier, but just as professional and real so don't feel bad about using `learn` and never using `git`.

However, sometimes in a lesson on Learn, we'll tell you to Fork and Clone a lab to get started or say something like "Fork this repo". We might use language relating to Git and GitHub to communicate to you that a lesson is a lab and you need to solve it by writing code and submitting it.

**Every single time you see a reference to forking, cloning, or GitHub to get started on a lab, you can just use `learn open` and the Learn CLI.** The `learn` CLI is exactly equivalent to the `git` workflow it's just automated. So understand that equivalence, GitHub Fork and `git clone` are the same as `learn open` which you're about to learn.
